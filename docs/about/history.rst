CodeGra.de's History
===========================

CodeGra.de originated as project in the Project Software Engineering course at
the University of Amsterdam. The project emerged from our own frustrations as
both students and teaching assistants in computer science at the UvA. As
students we lacked meaningful feedback to give us insight in our grade for
programming assignments. And as teaching assistants the amount of overhead
required to actually grade programming assignments in the traditional way, in
addition to the lack of providing useful feedback in a counter-intuitive
environment made the work very frustrating at times. This still drives us to
create a product that can revolutionise programming education to this date.
