Welcome to CodeGra.de
======================================
CodeGra.de is a blended learning application designed especially for programming
education. It makes grading and handing in programming exercises more insightful
and effective for students and more efficient for teachers.
Where programming exercises are currently reviewed in a classical and
counter-intuitive way, resulting in only little and vague feedback, CodeGra.de
creates the missing intuitive environment for reviewing programming exercises.

This is achieved using some of the key-features CodeGra.de provides:
- Line by line feedback making it possible to specifically write feedback for a
specific part of the code.
- CodeGra.de Filesystem enabling both students and teachers to access and hand
in files on the CodeGra.de system locally without any overhead.
- CodeGra.de editor plugins allowing the teacher to locally review programming
assignments and fill in rubrics using the editor of choice.

The code of CodeGra.de, the Filesystem and the numerous editor plugins is
open-source and available on `Github <https://github.com/CodeGra-de>`_.
