About Codegrade
---------------

This project started out as a university project for the course Software
Engineering at the the UvA (University of Amsterdam). Current grading
tools focus on classic writing assignments. As computer science students
(and teaching assistants) we noticed that a good piece of software for
grading code, and recieving feedback, was lacking. Welcome CodeGrade. With
CodeGrade one can grade code line by line, apply linters over the code,
add feedback shortcuts, and much more all in an intuitive interface.
CodeGrade is the first grading tool that started with code in mind.
CodeGrade is also integrated with LTI in online learning environments
such as Canvas or Blackboard.
