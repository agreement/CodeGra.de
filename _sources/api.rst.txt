Codegrade API documentation
=================================

This is the API documentation for API verion 1 of the codebuil.de
website.

General API rules
-------------------

URL buildup
~~~~~~~~~~~

All API URL's should prefix ``/api/v$x`` where ``$x`` is the current
version of the API, which is 1 at the moment of writing. After this
prefix the first comes the first *collection*, a collection is a set of
objects of something. Examples are schools, a set of multiple schools,
feedback, a set of feedback, or users, the set of multiple users. All
collections should always be plural nouns. When doing a request to the
collection this should apply to all items in this collection, when
allowed, filters can be used and should be passed as ``GET`` parameters.

However when querying a single object, always identified by id, this id
should be a new path in the URL. So querying a single school should use
the url ``/api/v1/schools/1``.

Collections can be nested, so multiple collections in a single URL,
however these rules should be followed. First a single directory in the
URL should always contain only one collection. Second the URL should be
read from left to right, so the URL
``/api/v1/schools/23/teachers/3/children/`` should return all children
of the teacher with id 3 of the school with id 23 (please not the
required trailing slash). All but the last collection should have an id
specifier when using nested collections, this means the pattern
``(collection/id)*/collection/(id)?`` (please note that there is **no**
trailing slash after an id) should always be used. For example the URL
``/api/v1/schools/teachers/`` is always illegal.

To sort, filter and search ``GET`` parameters should be passed (see the
next section for Http methods documentation), it should follow the
``key=value`` where the key should be generic, ``category`` instead of
``school_category``. A special case is the key ``sort``, where there can
be multiple options (separated by spaces) (these are the different sort
options) and each value should be prepended with either a ``-`` or a
``+`` meaning respectively sort descending and sort ascending.

Http methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Http methods should be used as the verb that can not be used in the URL.
The possible http methods are:

-  **GET**: This method should be used to get something from the server.
   It should not have any side effects, so it should not alter the
   database for example.
-  **POST**: This method should create a new object within the given
   collection. Once again the URL is used for filtering, for example a
   ``POST`` to ``/api/v1/schools/5/teacher`` should create a new teacher
   in the school with id 5. The content type should be
   ``application/json`` and the payload should be a valid JSON object.
-  **PUT**: This method should be used to update an existing object or
   create the object if it does not exist. Filtering should be done
   using the URL (please note that ``/api/v1/schools/5/teacher`` is not
   valid as this is not a single object), the content type
   ``application/json`` and the payload should be a valid JSON object.
-  **DELETE**: This method should be used to delete a object. The same
   rules apply as for the **PUT** method.
-  **PATCH**: This method is the same as the **PUT** method, however it
   will **NOT** create a new object if the object does not exist.

Other Http methods may **NOT** be used.

API responses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Http status codes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Http status codes should be used to convey the status of the request.
The entire list of status codes can be found online. However these are
the most important ones:

-  **200**: Everything went OK and the server should return a useful
   result.
-  **201**: This status should be used when a new resource is created
   after a POST, PUT request.
-  **204**: This status should be used if the request was correct but
   no content should be returned.
-  **400**: Should be signaled when a request was invalid.
-  **401**: Should be used when the user is not authorized, so if the
   user is not logged in.
-  **403**: Should be used when the user is logged in but the user is
   not authorized to see the requested object(s).
-  **404**: Should be used when the requested object does not exist.
-  **410**: Should be used if the object is no longer available.

Response
^^^^^^^^

The response of the server should always be a valid JSON object, unless
the status code is 204, in this case there should not be a response at
all.

This means that even if the status code is not 2xx (so not success),
there should be a response. In this case the response should be a JSON
object with at least the following keys:

-  **message**: A short message that is somewhat useful for a non
   technical user.
-  **description**: A technical error message that is somewhat useful
   for debugging purposes (please note that you should **NOT** send
   sensitive information).
-  **code**: The error code that should uniquely identify the error.

A error message may be nested, where the nested errors should be in an
array behind the key ``errors`` and every item in the array should be a
valid JSON error with the above specified required keys.

API documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every API end point for every http method should be documented. The
headline structure should follow that of the URL but in reverse. So the
API end ``/api/v1/schools/3/teachers`` should be documented under the
title Teachers, ander **under** teachers there should be a subsection
*schools*. Furthermore every API call should have input object, with
types for every key and description, and an example output object. Last
every API call should have a higher level description of the use and
working.
